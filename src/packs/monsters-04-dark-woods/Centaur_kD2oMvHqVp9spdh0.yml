      <blockquote>

      <p>It will be a gathering of clans unseen in this age. Call Stormhoof and
      Brightspear. Summon Whitemane and Ironflanks. Sound the horn and we shall
      begin our meeting—we shall speak the words and bind our people together.
      Too long have the men cut the ancient trees for their ships. The elves are
      weak and cowardly, friend to these mannish slime. It will be a cleansing
      fire from the darkest woods. Raise the red banner of war! Today we strike
      back against these apes and retake what is ours!</p>

      <li>Overrun them</li>

      <li>Fire a perfect bullseye</li>

      <li>Move with unrelenting speed</li>
