    biography: >-
      <p>On first glance, one might mistake the griffin for another magical
      mistake like the manticore or the chimera. It looks the part, doesn’t it?
      These creatures have the regal haughtiness of a lion and the arrogant
      bearing of an eagle, but they temper those with the unshakeable loyalty of
      both. To earn the friendship of a griffin is to have an ally all your
      living days. Truly a gift, that. If you’re ever lucky enough to meet one
      be respectful and deferential above all else. It may not seem it but they
      can perceive the subtlest slights and will answer them with a sharp beak
      and talons.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To serve allies</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Judge someone’s worthiness</li>

      <li>Carry an ally aloft</li>

      <li>Strike from above</li>

      </ul>
