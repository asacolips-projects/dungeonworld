    biography: >-
      <p>More beautiful by far than any man or woman born in the civil realms.
      To gaze upon one is to fall in love. Deep and punishing, too. Thing is,
      they don’t love—not the fleshy folk who often find them, anyway. Their
      love is a primal thing, married to the woods—to a great oak that serves as
      home and mother and sacred place to them. It’s a curse to see one, too,
      they’ll never love you back. No matter what you do. No matter how you
      pledge yourself to them, they’ll always spurn you. If ever their oak comes
      to harm, you’ve not only the dryad’s wrath to contend with, but in every
      nearby village there’s a score of men with a secret longing in their
      heart, ready to murder you where you sleep for just a smile from such a
      creature.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To love nature passionately</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Entice a mortal</li>

      <li>Merge into a tree</li>

      <li>Turn nature against them</li>

      </ul>
