    biography: >-
      <p>As horses are to the civil races, so go the worg to the goblins.
      Mounts, fierce in battle, ridden by only the bravest and most dangerous,
      are found and bred in the forest primeval to serve the goblins in their
      wars on men. The only safe worg is a pup, separated from its mother. If
      you can find one of these, or make orphans of a litter with a sharp sword,
      youâ€™ve got what could become a loyal protector or hunting hound in time.
      Train it well, mind you, for the worg are smart and never quite free of
      their primal urges.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To serve</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Carry a rider into battle</li>

      <li>Give its rider an advantage</li>

      </ul>
