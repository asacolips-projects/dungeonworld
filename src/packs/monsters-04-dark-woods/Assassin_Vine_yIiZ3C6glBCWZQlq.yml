    biography: >-
      <p>Among the animals there exists a clear division ‘tween hunter and
      hunted. All it takes is a glance to know—by fangs and glowing eyes or
      claws or venomous sting—which of the creatures of this world are meant to
      kill and which stand to be killed. Such a split, if you have the eyes to
      see it, cuts the world of leaves and flowers in twain, as well. Druids in
      their forest circles know it. Rangers, too, might spot such a plant before
      it’s too late. Lay folk, though, they wander where they oughtn’t—paths
      into the deep woods covered in creeping vines and with a snap, these
      hungry ropes snap tight, dragging their meaty prey into the underbrush.
      Mind your feet, traveller.</p>
