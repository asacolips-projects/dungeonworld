    biography: >-
      <p>The barrier between Dungeon World and the elemental planes is not, as
      you might hope, a wall of stone. It’s much more porous. Places where the
      civil races do not often tread can sometimes, how to put this, spring a
      leak. Like a dam come just a little loose. Bits and pieces of the chaos
      spill out. Sometimes, they’ll congeal like an egg on a pan—that’s where we
      get the material for many of the Guild’s magical trinkets. Useful, right?
      Sometimes, though, it squirms and squishes around a bit and stays that
      way, warping all it touches into some other, strange form. Chaos begets
      chaos, and it grows.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To change</p>

      <ol>

      <li>Cause a change in appearance or substance</li>

      <li>Briefly bridge the planes</li>
