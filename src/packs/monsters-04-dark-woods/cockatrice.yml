      <blockquote>

      <p>I ain’t ever seen such a thing, sir. Rodrick thought it a chicken,
      maybe. Poor Rodrick. I figured it to be a lizard of a sort, though he was
      right—it had a beak and gray feathers like a chicken. Right, well, see, we
      found it in the woods, in a nest at the foot of a tree while we were out
      with the sow. Looking for mushrooms, sir. I told Rodrick we were—yes, sir,
      right sir, the bird—see, it was glaring at Rodrick and he tried to scare
      it off with a stick to steal the eggs but the thing pecked his hand. Quick
      it was, too. I tried to get him away but he just got slower and slower
      and…yes, as you see him now, sir. All frozen up like when we left the dog
      out overnight in winter two years back. Poor, stupid Rodrick. Weren’t no
      bird nor lizard, were it, sir?</p>
