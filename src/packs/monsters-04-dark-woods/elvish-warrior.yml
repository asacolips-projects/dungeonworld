    biography: >-
      <p>”As with all things they undertake, the elves approach war as an art. I
      saw them fight, once. The Battle of Astrid’s Veil. Yes, I am that old,
      boy, now hush. A warrior-maiden, she was clad in plate that shone like the
      winter sky. White hair streaming and a pennant of ocean blue tied to her
      spear. She seemed to glide between the trees the way an angel might,
      striking out and bathing her blade in blood that steamed in the cold air.
      I never felt so small before. I trained with the master-at-arms of
      Battlemoore, you know. I’ve held a sword longer than you’ve been alive,
      boy, and in that one moment I knew that my skill meant nothing. Thank the
      gods the elves were with us then. A more beautiful and terrible thing I
      have never seen.”</p>

      <p>Instinct: To seek perfection</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Strike at a weak point</li>

      <li>Set ancient plans in motion</li>

      <li>Use the woods to advantage</li>

      </ul>
