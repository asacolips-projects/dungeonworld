    biography: >-
      <p>True elvish magic isnâ€™t like the spells of men. Mannish wizardry is all
      rotes and formulas. They cheat to find the arcane secrets that resound all
      around them. They are deaf to the arcane symphony that sings in the woods.
      Elvish magic requires a fine ear to hear that symphony and the voice with
      which to sing. To harmonize with what is already resounding. Men bind the
      forces of magic to their will; Elves simply pluck the strings and hum
      along. The High Arcanists, in a way, have become more and less than any
      elf. The beat of their blood is the throbbing of all magic in this
      world.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To unleash power</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Work the magic that nature demands</li>

      <li>Cast forth the elements</li>

      </ul>
