    biography: >-
      <p>Now you see it, now you don’t. Hounds once owned by a sorcerer lord and
      imbued with a kind of illusory cloak, they escaped into the woods around
      his lair and began to breed with wolves and wild dogs of the forest. You
      can spot them, if you’re lucky, by the glittering silver of their coats
      and their strange, ululating howls. They have a remarkable talent for
      being not quite where they appear to be and use it to take down prey much
      stronger than themselves. If you find yourself facing a pack of blink dogs
      you might as well close your eyes and fight. You’ll have an easier time
      when not betrayed by your natural sight. By such sorceries are the natural
      places of the world polluted with unnatural things.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To hunt</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Give the appearance of being somewhere they’re not</li>

      <li>Summon the pack</li>

      <li>Move with amazing speed</li>

      </ul>
