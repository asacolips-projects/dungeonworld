      <blockquote>

      <p>Beautiful, isn’t it? The moon, I mean. She’s watching us, you know? Her
      pretty silver eyes watch us while we sleep. Mad, too—like all the most
      beautiful ones. If she were a woman, I’d bend my knee and make her my wife
      on the spot. No, I didn’t ask you here to speak about her, though. The
      chains? For your safety, not mine. I’m cursed, you see. You must have
      suspected. The sorcerer-kings called it “lycanthropy” in their day—passed
      on by a bite to make more of our kind. No, I could find no cure. Please,
      don’t be scared. You have the arrows I gave you? Silver, yes. Ah, you
      begin to understand. Don’t cry, sister. You must do this for me. I cannot
      bear more blood on my hands. You must end this. For me.</p>

      <li>Strike from within</li>

      <li>Hunt like man and beast</li>
