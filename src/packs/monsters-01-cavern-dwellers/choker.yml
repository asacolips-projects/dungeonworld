    biography: >-
      <p>Some say these things descended from the family of a cruel wizard who
      forced them to live out their lives underground. They say his experiments
      led him to fear the sun and ages passed while he descended into unlife,
      dragging his folk along with him. These things resemble men, in a way.
      Head, four limbs and all that. Only their skin is wet and rubbery and
      their arms long and fingers grasping. They hate all life that bears the
      stink of the sun’s touch, as one might expect. Jealousy, long-instilled,
      is hard to shake.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To deny light</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Hold someone, wringing the breath from them</li>

      <li>Fling a held creature</li>

      </ul>
