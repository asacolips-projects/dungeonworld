    biography: >-
      <p>The mating call of the otyugh is a horrible, blaring cry that sounds
      like a cross between an elephant dying and an over-eager vulture. The
      otyugh spends much of its time partly submerged in filthy water and
      prefers eating garbage over any other food. As a result, it often grows
      fat and strong on the offal of orcs, goblins and other cave-dwelling
      sub-humans. Get too close, however, and you’ll have one of its barbed
      tentacles dragging you into that soggy, razor-toothed maw. If you get away
      with your life, best get to a doctor, or your victory may be short
      lived.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To befoul</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Infect someone with filth fever</li>

      <li>Fling someone or something</li>

      </ul>
