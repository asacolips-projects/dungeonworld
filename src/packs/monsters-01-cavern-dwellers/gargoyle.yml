    biography: >-
      <p>It’s a sad thing, really. Guardians bred by magi of the past with no
      more castles to guard. Their ancestors’ sacred task bred into their blood
      leads them to find a place—ruins mostly, but sometimes a cave or hill or
      mountain cliff—and guard it as though their masters yet lived below.
      They’re notoriously good at finding valuables buried below the earth,
      though. Find one of these winged reptiles and you’ll find yourself a
      treasure nearby. Just be careful, they’re hard to spot and tend to move in
      packs.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To guard</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Attack with the element of surprise</li>

      <li>Take to the air</li>

      <li>Blend into stonework</li>

      </ul>
