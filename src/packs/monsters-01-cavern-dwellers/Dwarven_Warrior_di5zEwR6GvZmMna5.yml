    biography: >-
      <p>For ages, men believed all dwarves were male and all were of this ilk:
      stoic and proud warriors. Axe-wielding and plate-wearing. Stout bearded
      battle-hungry dwarves who would push them, time and time again, back up
      out of their mines and tunnels with ferocity. It just goes to show how
      little men know about the elder races. These folk are merely a vanguard,
      and they bravely do their duty to protect the riches of the Dwarven realm.
      Earn their trust and you’ve an ally for life. Earn their ire and you’re
      not likely to regret it very long.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To defend</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Drive them back</li>

      <li>Call up reinforcements</li>

      </ul>
