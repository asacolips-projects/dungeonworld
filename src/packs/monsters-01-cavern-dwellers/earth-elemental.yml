    biography: >-
      <p>Our shaman says that all the things of the world have a spirit. Stones,
      trees, a stream. Now that I’ve seen the earth roil under my feet and fists
      of stone beat my friends half to death I’d like to believe that crazy old
      man. The one I saw was huge—big as a house! It came boiling up from a
      rockslide out of nowhere and had a voice like an avalanche. I pay my
      respects, now. Rightly so.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To show the strength of earth</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Turn the ground into a weapon</li>

      <li>Meld into stone</li>

      </ul>
