    biography: >-
      <p>Respected by all who gaze upon them, the high priests and abbesses of
      Dungeon World are treated with a sort of reverence. Whether they pay
      homage to Ur-thuu-hak, God of Swords, or whisper quiet prayers to Namiah,
      precious daughter of peace, they know a thing or two that you and I won’t
      ever know. The gods speak to them as a hawker-of-wares might speak to us
      in the marketplace. For this, for the bearing-of-secrets and the
      knowing-of-things, we give them a wide berth as they pass in their shining
      robes.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To lead</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Set down divine law</li>

      <li>Reveal divine secrets</li>

      <li>Commission divine undertakings</li>

      </ul>
