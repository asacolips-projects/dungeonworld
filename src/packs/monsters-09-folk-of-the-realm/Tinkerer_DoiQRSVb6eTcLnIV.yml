    biography: >-
      <p>It’s said that if you see a tinker on the road and you don’t offer him
      a swig of ale or some of your food that he’ll leave a curse of bad luck
      behind. A tinker is a funny thing. These strange folk often travel the
      roads between towns with their oddment carts and favorite mules. With a
      ratty dog and always a story to tell. Sometimes the mail, too, if you’re
      lucky and live in a place where Queen’s Post won’t go. If you’re kind,
      maybe they’ll sell you a rose that never wilts or a clock that chimes with
      the sound of faerie laughter. Or maybe they’re just antisocial peddlers.
      You never know, right?</p>

      <p>Instinct: To create</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Offer an oddity at a price</li>

      <li>Spin tales of great danger and reward in far-off lands</li>

      </ul>
