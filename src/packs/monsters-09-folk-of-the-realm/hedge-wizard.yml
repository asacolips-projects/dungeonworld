    biography: >-
      <p>Not all those who wield the arcane arts are adventuring wizards. Nor
      necromancers in mausoleums or sorcerers of ancient bloodline. Some are
      just old men and women, smart enough to have discovered a trick or two. It
      might make them a bit batty to come by that knowledge, but if youâ€™ve a
      curse to break or a love to prove, might be that a hedge wizard will help
      you, if you can find his rotten hut in the swamp and pay the price he
      asks.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To learn</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Cast almost the right spell (for a price)</li>

      <li>Make deals beyond their ken</li>

      </ul>
