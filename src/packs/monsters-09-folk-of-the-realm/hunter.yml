    biography: >-
      <p>The wilds are home to more than just beasts of horn and scale. There
      are men and women out there, tooâ€”those who smell blood on the wind and
      stalk the plains in the skins of their prey. Whether with a trusty longbow
      bought on a rare trip into the city or with a knife of bone and sinew,
      these folk have more in common with the things they track and eat than
      with their own kind. Solemn, somber and quiet, they find a sort of peace
      in the wild.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To survive</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Bring back news from the wilds</li>

      <li>Slay a beast</li>

      </ul>
