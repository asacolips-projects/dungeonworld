    biography: >-
      <p>The wilds are home to more than just beasts of horn and scale. There
      are men and women out there, too—those who smell blood on the wind and
      stalk the plains in the skins of their prey. Whether with a trusty longbow
      bought on a rare trip into the city or with a knife of bone and sinew,
      these folk have more in common with the things they track and eat than
      with their own kind. Solemn, somber and quiet, they find a sort of peace
      in the wild.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To survive</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Bring back news from the wilds</li>

      <li>Slay a beast</li>

      </ul>
