    biography: >-
      <p>It would be foolish, now, to draw conclusions about folks just because
      they happen to be good at one thing or another. Then again, a spade’s a
      spade, isn’t it. Or maybe just the goodly, soft-and-sweet type of Halfling
      have the mind to stay in their grassy-hill homes and aren’t the type you
      find in the slums and taverns of the mannish world. Perhaps they’re there
      to cut your purse for calling them “halfling” in the first place. Not all
      take so kindly to the title. Or they’re playing a game, pretending to be a
      child in need of alms—and your arrogant eyes can’t even see the difference
      until too late. Well, it matters little. They’re gone with your coin
      before you even realize you deserved it.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To live a life of stolen luxury</p>

      <li>Steal</li>

      <li>Put on the appearance of friendship</li>
