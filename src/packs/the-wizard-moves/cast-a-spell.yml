    <p>When you <strong>release a spell you’ve prepared</strong>, roll+INT. • On
    a 10+ the the spell is successfully cast and you may cast the spell again
    later. • On a 7-9 the spell is cast, but choose one:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>You draw unwelcome attention or put yourself in a spot. The GM will tell
    you how.</li>

    <li>The spell disturbs the fabric of reality as it is cast; take -1 ongoing
    to cast a spell until the next time you Prepare Spells.</li>

    <li>After it is cast, the spell is forgotten. You cannot cast the spell
    again until you prepare spells.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Note that maintaining spells with ongoing effects will sometimes cause a
    penalty to your roll to cast a spell.</p>
