  description: >-
    <p>When you attempt to <strong>counter an arcane spell</strong> that will
    otherwise affect you, stake one of your prepared spells on the
    defense&nbsp;and roll+INT. On a 10+, the spell is countered and has no
    effect on you. On a 7-9, the spell is countered and you forget the spell
    that you staked. Your counterspell protects you alone; if the countered
    spell has other targets they are affected as normal.</p>
