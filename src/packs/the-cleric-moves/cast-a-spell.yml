    <p>When you <strong>unleash a spell granted by your deity</strong>,
    roll+WIS. • On a 10+ the the spell is successfully cast and your deity does
    not revoke the spell, so you may cast it again.</p>

    <ul>

    <li>On a 7-9 the spell is cast, but choose one:</li>

    <li>You draw unwelcome attention or put yourself in a spot. The GM will tell
    you how.</li>

    <li>Your casting distances you from your deity; take -1 ongoing to cast a
    spell until the next time you commune.</li>

    <li>After it is cast, the spell is revoked by your deity. You cannot cast
    the spell again until you commune and have it granted to you.</li>

    </ul>
