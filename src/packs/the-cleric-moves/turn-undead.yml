    <p>When you <strong>hold your holy symbol aloft and call on your deity for
    protection</strong>, roll+Wis. • On a 7+, so long as you continue to pray
    and brandish your holy symbol, no undead may come within reach of you. • On
    a 10+, you also momentarily daze intelligent undead and cause mindless
    undead to flee. Aggression breaks the effects and they are able to act as
    normal.</p>
