    biography: >-
      <p>Corpses sewn onto corpses make up the bulk of these shambling masses of
      dark magic. Most undead are crafted to be controlled, made to serve some
      purpose like building a tower or serving as guardians. Not so the
      abomination. The last aspect of the ritual used to grant fire to their
      hellish limbs invokes a hatred so severe that the abomination knows but
      one task: to tear and rend at the very thing it cannot have, life. Many
      students of the black arts learn to their mortal dismay the most important
      fact about these hulks; an abomination knows no master.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To end life</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Tear flesh apart</li>

      <li>Spill forth putrid guts</li>

      </ul>
