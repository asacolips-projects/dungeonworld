    biography: >-
      <p>You never get away with murder. Not really. You might evade the law,
      might escape your own conscience in the end and die, fat and happy in a
      mansion somewhere. When the gods themselves notice your misdeeds, though,
      that’s where your luck runs out and a mohrg is born. The mohrg is a
      skeleton—flesh and skin and hair all rotted away. All but their guts—their
      twisted, knotted guts still spill from their bellies, magically preserved
      and often wrapped, noose-like, about their necks. They do not think,
      exactly, but they suffer. They kill and wreak havoc and their souls do not
      rest. Such is the punishment, both on them for the crime and on all
      mankind for daring to murder one another. The gods are just and they are
      harsh.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To wreak havoc</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Rage</li>

      <li>Add to their collection of guts</li>

      </ul>
