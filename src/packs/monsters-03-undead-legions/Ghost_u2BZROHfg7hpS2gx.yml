    biography: >-
      <p>Every culture tells the story the same way. You live, you love or you
      hate, you win or you lose, you die somehow you’re not too fond of and here
      you are, ghostly and full of disappointment and what have you. Some people
      take it upon themselves, brave and kindly folks, to seek out the dead and
      help them pass to their rightful rest. You can find them, most times, down
      at the tavern drinking away the terrors they’ve seen or babbling to
      themselves in the madhouse. Death takes a toll on the living, no matter
      how you come by it.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To haunt</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Reveal the terrifying nature of death</li>

      <li>Haunt a place of importance</li>

      <li>Offer information from the other side, at a price</li>

      </ul>
