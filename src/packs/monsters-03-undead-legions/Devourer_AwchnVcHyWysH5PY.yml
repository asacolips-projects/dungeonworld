    biography: >-
      <p>Most folk know that the undead feed on flesh. The warmth, blood and
      living tissue continue their unholy existence. This is true for most of
      the mindless dead, animated by black sorcery. Not so the devourer. When a
      particularly wicked person (often a manipulator of men, an apostate priest
      or the like) dies in a gruesome way, the dark powers of Dungeon World
      might bring them back to a kind of life. The devourer, however, does not
      feed on the flesh of men or elves. The devourer eats souls. It kills with
      a pleasure only the sentient can enjoy and in the moments of its victims’
      expiry, draws breath like a drowning man and swallows a soul. What does it
      mean to have your soul eaten by such a creature? None dare ask for fear of
      finding out.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To feast on souls</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Devour or trap dying soul</li>

      <li>Bargain for a soul’s return</li>

      </ul>
