    biography: >-
      <p>We fear them, because they call to us. So much like us, or how we hope
      to be: beautiful, passionate, and powerful. They are drawn to us for what
      they cannot be: warm, kind, and alive. These tormented souls can only
      hope, at most, to pass their dreadful curse along. Every time they feed
      they run the risk of passing along their torture to another and in each
      one lives the twisted seed of its creator. Vampires beget vampires.
      Suffering begets suffering. Do not be drawn in by their seduction or you
      may be given their giftâ€”a crown of shadows and the of chains eternal
      undying grief.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To manipulate</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Charm someone</li>

      <li>Feed on their blood</li>

      <li>Retreat to plan again</li>

      </ul>
