    biography: >-
      <p>Come away from an encounter with one of these vengeful spirits merely
      deaf and count yourself lucky for the rest of your peaceful, silent days.
      Often mistaken at first glance for a ghost or wandering spirit, the
      banshee reveals a far more deadly talent for sonic assault when angered.
      And her anger comes easy. A victim of betrayal (often by a loved one) the
      banshee makes known her displeasure with a roar or scream that can putrefy
      flesh and rend the senses. If you can help her get her vengeance, they say
      she might grant rewards. Whether the affection of a spurned spirit is a
      thing you’d want, well, that’s another question.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To get revenge</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Drown out all other sound with a ceaseless scream</li>

      <li>Unleash a skull-splitting noise</li>

      <li>Disappear into the mists</li>

      </ul>
