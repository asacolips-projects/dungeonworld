    biography: >-
      <p>For some folk, when they pass, Death himself cannot release their grip
      on the places they love most. A priest whose devotion to the temple is
      greater than that of his god. A banking guild official who cannot bear to
      part with his vault. A drunk and his favorite tavern. All make excellent
      spectres. They act not out of the usual hunger that drives the undead, but
      jealousy. Jealousy that anyone else might come to love their home as much
      as they do and drive them out. These places belong to them and these
      invisible spirits will kill before theyâ€™ll let anyone send them to their
      rest.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To drive life from a place</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Turn their haunt against a creature</li>

      <li>Bring the environment to life</li>

      </ul>
