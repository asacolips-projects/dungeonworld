  details:
    biography: >-
      <p>The medusa are children of a serpent-haired mother, birthing them in
      ancient times to bear her name across the ages. They dwell near places of
      civilization—luring folks to their caves with promises of beauty or riches
      untold. Fine appreciators of art, the medusa curate strange collections of
      their victims, terror or ecstasy frozen forever in stone. It satisfies
      their vanity to know they were the last thing seen in so many lives.
      Arrogant, proud, and spiteful, in their way, they seek what so many
      do—endless company.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To collect</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Turn a body part to stone with a look</li>

      <li>Draw someone’s gaze</li>

      <li>Show hidden terrible beauty</li>

      </ul>
