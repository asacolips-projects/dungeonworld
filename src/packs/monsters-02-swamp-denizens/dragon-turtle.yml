    biography: >-
      <p>Bakunawa has a brother. Where she is quick to anger and hungry for
      gold, he is slow and sturdy. She is a knife and he is a shield. A great
      turtle that lies in the muck and mire for ages as they pass, mud piled
      upon his backâ€”sometimes trees and shrubs. Sometimes a whole misguided clan
      of goblins will build their huts and cook their ratty meals on the shell
      of the dragon turtle. His snapping jaws may be glacier-slow, but they can
      rend a castle wall. Careful where you tread.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To resist change</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Move forward implacably</li>

      <li>Bring its full bulk to bear</li>

      <li>Destroy structures and buildings</li>

      </ul>
