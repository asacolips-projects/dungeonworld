    biography: >-
      <p>These strange creatures are no bigger or smarter than their mundane
      kin. They have the same vicious nature. Over their relations they have one
      advantage—an oily secretion that oozes from their skin. It makes them hard
      to catch. On top of that, with a twist of their body they can ignite the
      stuff, leaving pools of burning oil atop the surface of the water and
      roasting prey and predator alike. I hear the slimy things make good
      ingredients for fire-resistant gear, but you have to get your hands on
      one, first.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Instinct: To ignite</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Catch someone or something on fire (even underwater)</li>

      <li>Consume burning prey</li>

      </ul>
