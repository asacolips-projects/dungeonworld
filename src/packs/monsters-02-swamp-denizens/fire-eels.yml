    biography: >-
      <p>These strange creatures are no bigger or smarter than their mundane
      kin. They have the same vicious nature. Over their relations they have one
      advantageâ€”an oily secretion that oozes from their skin. It makes them hard
      to catch. On top of that, with a twist of their body they can ignite the
      stuff, leaving pools of burning oil atop the surface of the water and
      roasting prey and predator alike. I hear the slimy things make good
      ingredients for fire-resistant gear, but you have to get your hands on
      one, first.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Instinct: To ignite</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Catch someone or something on fire (even underwater)</li>

      <li>Consume burning prey</li>

      </ul>
