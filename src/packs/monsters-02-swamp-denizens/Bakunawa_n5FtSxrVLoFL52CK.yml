    biography: >-
      <p>Dragon-Turtle’s sister is a mighty serpent queen. Ten yards of scales
      and muscle, they say she wakes with a hunger when the sun disappears from
      the sky. She is attracted by bright light in the darkness and like any
      snake, the Bakunawa is sneaky. She will seek first to beguile and mislead
      and will only strike out with violence when no other option is available.
      When she does, though, her jaws are strong enough to crack the hull of any
      swamp-boat and certainly enough to slice through a steel breastplate or
      two. Give the greedy snake your treasures and she might just leave you
      alone.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To devour</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Lure prey with lies and illusions</li>

      <li>Lash out at light</li>

      <li>Devour</li>

      </ul>
