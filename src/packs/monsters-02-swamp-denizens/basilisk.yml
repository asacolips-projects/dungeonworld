      <blockquote>

      <p>Few have seen a basilisk and lived to tell the tale. Get it? Seen a
      basilisk? Little bit of basilisk humor there. Sorry, I know you’re looking
      for something helpful, sirs. Serious stuff, I understand. The basilisk,
      even without its ability to turn your flesh to stone with a gaze, is a
      dangerous creature. A bit like a frog, bulbous eyes and six muscled legs
      built for leaping. A bit like an alligator, with snapping jaws and sawing
      teeth. Covered in stony scales and very hard to kill. Best avoided, if
      possible.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To create new statuary</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Turn flesh to stone with a gaze</li>

      <li>Retreat into a maze of stone</li>

      </ul>
