    biography: >-
      <p>Their natural form, if you ever see it, is hideous. Like a creature who
      stopped growing part-way, before it decided it was elf or man or dwarf.
      Then again, maybe that’s how you get to be the way a doppelgänger
      is—without form, without shape to call their own, maybe all they really
      seek is a place to fit in. If you go out into the world, when you come
      back home, make sure your friends are who you think they are. They might,
      instead, be a doppelgänger and your friend might be dead at the bottom of
      a well somewhere. Then again, depending on your friends, that might be an
      improvement.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To infiltrate</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Assume the shape of a person whose flesh it’s tasted</li>

      <li>Use another’s identity to advantage</li>

      <li>Leave someone’s reputation shattered</li>

      </ul>
