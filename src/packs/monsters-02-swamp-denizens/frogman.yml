    biography: >-
      <p>Croak croak croak. Little warty munchkins. Some wizard or
      godling&rsquo;s idea of a bad joke, these creatures are. They stand as
      men, dress in scavenged cloth and hold court in their froggy villages.
      They speak a rumbling pidgin form of the tongue of man and are constantly
      at war with their neighbors. They&rsquo;re greedy and stupid but clever
      enough when they need to defend themselves. Some say, too, their priests
      have a remarkable skill at healing. Or maybe they&rsquo;re just really,
      really hard to kill.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To wage war</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Launch an amphibious assault</li>

      <li>Heal at a prodigious rate</li>

      </ul>
