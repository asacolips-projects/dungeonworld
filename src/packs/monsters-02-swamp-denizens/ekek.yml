    biography: >-
      <p>Ugly, wrinkled bird-folk, these. Once, maybe, in some ancient past,
      they were a race of angelic men from on high, but now they eat rats that
      they fish from the murk with talon-feet and devour with needle-teeth. They
      understand the tongues of men and dwarves but speak in little more than
      gibbering tongues, mimicking the words they hear with mocking laughter.
      It’s a chilling thing to see a beast so close to man or bird but not quite
      either one.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Instinct: To lash out</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Attack from the air</li>

      <li>Carry out the bidding of a more powerful creature</li>

      </ul>
