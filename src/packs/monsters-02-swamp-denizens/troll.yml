    biography: >-
      <p>Tall. Real tall. Eight or nine feet when they’re young or weak. Covered
      all over in warty, tough skin, too. Big teeth, stringy hair like swamp
      moss and long, dirty nails. Some are green, some gray, some black. They’re
      clannish and hateful of each other, not to mention all the rest of us.
      Near impossible to kill, too, unless you’ve fire or acid to spare—cut a
      limb off and watch. In a few days, you’ve got two trolls where you once
      had one. A real serious problem, as you can imagine.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To smash</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Undo the effects of an attack (unless caused by a weakness, your
      call)</li>

      <li>Hurl something or someone</li>

      </ul>
