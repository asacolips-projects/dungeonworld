    biography: >-
      <p>Some elementals are conjured up in sacred circles etched in chalk.
      Most, in fact. There’s a sort of science to it. Others, though, aren’t so
      orderly—they don’t fall under the carefully controlled assignments of
      fire, air, water, or earth. Some are a natural confluence of vine and mire
      and fungus. They do not think the way a man might think. They cannot be
      understood as one might understand an elf. They simply are. Spirits of the
      swamp. Shamblers in the mud.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To preserve and create swamps</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Call on the swamp itself for aid</li>

      <li>Meld into the swamp</li>

      <li>Reassemble into a new form</li>

      </ul>
