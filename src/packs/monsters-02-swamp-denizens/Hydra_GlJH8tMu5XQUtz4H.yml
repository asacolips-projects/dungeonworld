  details:
    biography: >-
      <p>A bit like a dragon, wingless though it may be. Heads, nine in number
      at birth, spring from a muscled trunk and weave a sinuous pattern in the
      air. A hydra is to be feared&mdash;a scaled terror of the marsh. The older
      ones, though, they have more heads, for every failed attempt to murder it
      just makes it stronger. Cut off a head and two more grow in its place.
      Only a strike, true and strong, to the heart can end a hydra&rsquo;s life.
      Not time or tide or any other thing but this.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To grow</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Attack many enemies at once</li>

      <li>Regenerate a body part (especially a head)</li>

      </ul>
