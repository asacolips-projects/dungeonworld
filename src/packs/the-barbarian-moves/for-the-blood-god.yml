    <p>You are initiated in the old ways, the ways of sacrifice. Choose
    something your gods (or the ancestor spirits, or your totem, etc)
    value—gold, blood, bones or the like. When you <strong>sacrifice those
    things as per your rites and rituals</strong>, roll+WIS.</p>

    <ul>

    <li>On a 10+ the GM will grant you insight into your current trouble or a
    boon to help you.</li>

    <li>On a 7-9 the sacrifice is not enough and your gods take of your flesh as
    well, but still grant you some insight or boon. • On a miss, you earn the
    ire of the fickle spirits.</li>
