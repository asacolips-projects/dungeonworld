    biography: >-
      <p>The pounding of the jungle drums calls to it. The slab of meat on the
      sacrificial stone to lure in the great ape. Girallon, they call it—a name
      from the long-forgotten tongue of the kings who bred the beast. Taller
      than a building, some say. Cloaked in ivory fur with tusks as long as
      scimitars. Four arms? Six? The rumors are hard to verify. Every year it is
      the same: some explorer visits the jungle villages seeking the ape and
      returns, never quite the same, never with a trophy. The pounding of the
      drums goes on.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To rule</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Answer the call of sacrifice</li>

      <li>Drive them from the jungle</li>

      <li>Throw someone</li>

      </ul>
