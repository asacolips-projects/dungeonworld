    biography: >-
      <p>It’s okay, magical experimentation is a messy science. For every
      beautiful pegasus there’s a half-done creature that wasn’t quite right. We
      understand. The goblin-elephant you thought was such a great idea. The
      Gelatinous Drake. Just examples. No judgement here. Anyway, we’ve got
      something for that. We call it the Digester. Yes, just like it sounds.
      Strange looking, I know, and the smell isn’t the best, but this
      thing—it’ll eat magic like Svenloff the Stout drinks ale. Next time one of
      these unfortunate accidents occurs, just point the Digester at it and all
      your troubles drain away. Just keep an eye on it. Damn thing ate my wand
      last week.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To digest</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Eat away at something</li>

      <li>Draw sustenance</li>
