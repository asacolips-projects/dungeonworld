    biography: >-
      <p>It’s typical to think that all the malignant arcane monsters made in
      this world are birthed by wizards, sorcerers, and their ilk. That the
      colleges and towers of Dungeon World are womb to every bleak experiment.
      There are mistakes made in the depths of the earth, too. These ones, the
      derro, are the mistakes of a long-forgotten dwarven alchemist. The derro
      don’t forget, though. Twisted and hateful, the derro can be spotted by
      their swollen skulls, brain-matter grown too large. They do not speak
      except in thoughts to one another and plot in the silent dark to extract
      sweetest revenge—that of the created on the creator.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To replace dwarves</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Fill a mind with foreign thoughts</li>

      <li>Take control of a beast’s mind</li>

      </ul>
