    biography: >-
      <p>The pounding of the jungle drums calls to it. The slab of meat on the
      sacrificial stone to lure in the great ape. Girallon, they call itâ€”a name
      from the long-forgotten tongue of the kings who bred the beast. Taller
      than a building, some say. Cloaked in ivory fur with tusks as long as
      scimitars. Four arms? Six? The rumors are hard to verify. Every year it is
      the same: some explorer visits the jungle villages seeking the ape and
      returns, never quite the same, never with a trophy. The pounding of the
      drums goes on.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To rule</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Answer the call of sacrifice</li>

      <li>Drive them from the jungle</li>

      <li>Throw someone</li>

      </ul>
