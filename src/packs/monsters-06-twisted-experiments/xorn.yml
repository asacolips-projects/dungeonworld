    biography: >-
      <p>Dwarf-made elemental garbage muncher. Shaped like a trash bin with a
      radius of arms to feed excess rock and stone into its gaping maw. They eat
      stone and excrete light and heat. Perfect for operating a mine or digging
      out a quarry. Once one gets lost in the sewers below a city, though, or in
      the foundation of a castle? You’re in deep trouble. They’ll eat and eat
      until you’ve got nothing left but to collapse the place down on it and
      move somewhere else. Ask Burrin, Son of Fjornnvald, exile from his clan. I
      bet he could tell you a story about a xorn.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To eat</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Consume stone</li>

      <li>Give off a burst of light and heat</li>

      </ul>
