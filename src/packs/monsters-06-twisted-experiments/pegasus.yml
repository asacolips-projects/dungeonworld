    biography: >-
      <p>Don’t go thinking that every creature not natural-born is a horrible
      abomination. Don’t imagine for a second that they’re all tentacles and
      screaming and blood or whatever. Take this noble beast, for example.
      Lovely thing, isn’t it? A fine white horse with the wings of a swan. Don’t
      look like it ought to be able to fly, but it does. The elves work
      miracles, in their own way. They breed true—that’s the purity of elf-magic
      at work. Hatching from little crystal eggs and bonded with their riders
      for life. There’s still some beauty in the world, mark my words.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To carry aloft</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Carry a rider into the air</li>

      <li>Give their rider an advantage</li>

      </ul>
