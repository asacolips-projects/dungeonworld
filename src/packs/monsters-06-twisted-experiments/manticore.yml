    biography: >-
      <p>If the chimera is the first step down a dark path, the manticore is a
      door that can’t be closed once it’s been opened. A lion, a scorpion, the
      wings of a drake. All difficult to obtain but not impossible and just
      animals, anyway. The last component, the hissing hateful face of the
      beast, is the ingredient that makes a manticore so cruel. Young or old,
      man or woman, it matters not but that they are human, living and
      breathing, married to the creature with twisted magic. All sense of who
      they are is lost, and maybe that’s a blessing, but the beast is born from
      human suffering. No wonder, then, that they’re all so eager to kill.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To kill</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Poison them</li>

      <li>Rip something apart</li>

      </ul>
