    biography: >-
      <p>”A cephalo-what? No, boy. Not “a kraken” but “the kraken.” I don’t know
      what nonsense they taught you at that school you say you’re from, but
      here, we know to respect the Hungerer. Right, that’s what we call it, The
      Hungerer in the Deep to be more proper. Ain’t no god, though we’ve got
      those, too. It’s a squid! A mighty squid with tentacles thicker ‘round
      than a barrel and eyes the size of the full moon. Smart, too, the
      Hungerer. Knows just when to strike—when you’re all too drunk or too tired
      or run out of clean water, that’s when he gets you. No, I ain’t ever seen
      him. I’m alive, aren’t I?”</p>

      <p>Instinct: To rule the ocean</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Drag a person or ship to a watery grave</li>

      <li>Wrap them in tentacles</li>

      </ul>
