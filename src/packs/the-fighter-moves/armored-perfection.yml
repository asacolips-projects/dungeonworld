  description: >-
    <p>When you choose to <strong>let your armor take the brunt of
    damage</strong> dealt to you, the damage is negated and you take +1 forward
    against the attacker, but you must reduce the armor value of your armor or
    shield (your choice) by 1. The value is reduced each time you make this
    choice. If the reduction leaves the item with 0 armor it is destroyed.</p>
