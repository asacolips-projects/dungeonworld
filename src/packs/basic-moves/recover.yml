    <p>When you <strong>do nothing but rest in comfort and safety</strong> after
    a day of rest you recover all your HP. After three days of rest you remove
    one debility of your choice. If you’re under the care of a healer (magical
    or otherwise) you heal a debility for every two days of rest instead.</p>
