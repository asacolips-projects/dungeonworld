    <p>When you <strong>have downtime (hours or days) and XP equal to (or
    greater than) your current level+7</strong>, subtract your current level +7
    from your XP, increase your level by 1, and choose a new advanced move from
    your class. If you are the wizard, you also get to add a new spell to your
    spellbook. Choose one of your stats and increase it by 1 (this may change
    your modifier). Note that changing your Constitution increases your maximum
    and current HP. Ability scores can’t go higher than 18.</p>
