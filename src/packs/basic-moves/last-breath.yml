  description: >-
    <p>When you’re <strong>dying </strong>you catch a glimpse of what lies
    beyond the Black Gates of Death’s Kingdom (the GM will describe it). Then
    roll (just roll, +nothing—yeah, Death doesn’t care how tough or cool you
    are). On a 10+ you’ve cheated death— you’re in a bad spot but you’re still
    alive. On a 7–9 Death will offer you a bargain. Take it and stabilize or
    refuse and pass beyond the Black Gates into whatever fate awaits you. On a
    miss, your fate is sealed. You’re marked as Death’s own and you’ll cross the
    threshold soon. The GM will tell you when.</p>
