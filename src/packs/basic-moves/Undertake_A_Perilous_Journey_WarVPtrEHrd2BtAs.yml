    member of the party to act as trailblazer, one to scout ahead, and one to be
    quartermaster (the same character cannot have two jobs). If you don’t have
    enough party members or choose not to assign a job, treat that job as if it
    had rolled a 6. Each character with a job to do rolls+Wis.</p>

        will spot any trouble quick enough to let you get the drop on
        it.</li></ul>
