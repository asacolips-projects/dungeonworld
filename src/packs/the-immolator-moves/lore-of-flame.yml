    <p>When you <strong>stare into a source of fire</strong>, looking for
    answers, roll+WIS. On a hit, the GM will tell you something new and
    interesting about the current situation. On a 10+, the GM will give you good
    detail. On a 7–9, the GM will give you an impression. If you already know
    all there is to know, the GM will tell you that.</p>
