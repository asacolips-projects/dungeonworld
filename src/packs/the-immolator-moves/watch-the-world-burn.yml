  description: >-
    <p>When you <strong>open a channel to the burning planes</strong> and call a
    firestorm, tell the GM what youâ€™re sacrificing and roll+WIS. The sky opens
    up and fire pours like rain from it within an area about equal to a small
    village. Everyone and everything in the area takes damage as appropriate. On
    a 10+ you can extinguish the storm with a little effort. On a 7-9 the fires
    rage out of your control, spreading and gusting where they are carried by
    wind and weather. On a miss, something cruel, intelligent and hungry comes
    with the storm.</p>
