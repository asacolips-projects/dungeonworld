    <p>When you<strong> tempt a weak mind with your inner fire</strong>,

    you desire, so long as nothing startles or surprises them. On a 7-9, the
    effect is only strong enough to distract or confuse them. On a miss, they
    become agitated and upset, your fire having sparked their hidden
    desires.</p>
