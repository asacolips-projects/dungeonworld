    <p>When you <strong>shapeshift</strong>, you may create a merged form of up
    to three different shapes. You may be a bear with the wings of an eagle and
    the head of a ram, for example. Each feature will grant you a different move
    to make. Your chimera form follows the same rules as shapeshifter
    otherwise.</p>
