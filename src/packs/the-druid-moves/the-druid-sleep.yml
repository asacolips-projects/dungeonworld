    <p>When you take this move, the next opportunity that you have safety and
    time to spend in an appropriate location, you may attune yourself to a new
    land. This effect occurs only once and the GM will tell you how long it will
    take and what cost you must pay. From then on, you are considered to be born
    of the soil in both lands.</p>
