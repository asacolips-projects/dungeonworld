    <p>You learned your magic in a place whose spirits are strong and ancient
    and they’ve marked you as one of their own. No matter where you go, they
    live within you and allow you to take their shape. Choose one of the
    following. It is the land to which you are attuned—when shapeshifting you
    may take the shape of any animal who might live in your Land.</p>

    <ul>

    <li>The Great Forests</li>

    <li>The Whispering Plains</li>

    <li>The Vast Desert</li>

    <li>The Stinking Mire</li>

    <li>The River Delta</li>

    <li>The Depths of the Earth</li>

    <li>The Sapphire Islands</li>

    <li>The Open Sea</li>

    <li>The Towering Mountains</li>

    <li>The Frozen North</li>

    <li>The Blasted Wasteland</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Chose a tell—a physical attribute that marks you as born of the soil—that
    reflects the spirit of your land. It may be an animal feature like antlers
    or leopard’s spots or something more general: hair like leaves or eyes of
    glittering crystal. Your tell remains no matter what shape you take.</p>
