  <h1>Armor Tags</h1>

  <p>Armor, like weapons, has tags. Some are purely descriptive but the ones
  below have some mechanical effect on the player wearing them</p>

  <ul>

  <li><strong>n Armor: </strong>It protects you from harm and absorbs damage.
  When you take damage, subtract your armor from the total. If you have more
  than one item with n Armor, only the highest value counts.</li>

  <li><strong>+n Armor: </strong>It protects you and stacks with other armor.
  Add its value to your total armor.</li>

  <li><strong>Clumsy: </strong>It&rsquo;s tough to move around with. -1 ongoing
  while using it. This penalty is cumulative.</li>

  </ul>
