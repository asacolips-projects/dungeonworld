  <h1>Skills</h1>

  <h2>Adept</h2>

  <p>An adept has at least apprenticed to an arcane expert, but is not powerful
  in their own right. They&rsquo;re the grad students of the arcane world.</p>

  <p><br /><strong>Arcane Assistance&mdash;</strong>When an adept aids in the
  casting of a spell of lower level than their skill, the spell&rsquo;s effects
  have greater range, duration, or potency. The exact effects depend on the
  situation and the spell and are up to the GM. The GM will describe what
  effects the assist will add before the spell is cast. The most important
  feature of casting with an adept is that any negative effects of the casting
  are focused on the adept first.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h2>Burglar</h2>

  <p>Burglars are skilled in a variety of areas, most of them illicit or
  dangerous. They are good with devices and traps, but not too helpful in the
  field of battle.</p>

  <p><br /><strong>Experimental Trap Disarming&mdash;</strong>When a burglar
  leads the way they can detect traps almost in time. If a trap would be sprung
  while a burglar is leading the way the burglar suffers the full effects but
  the players get +skill against the trap and add the burglar&rsquo;s skill to
  their armor against the trap. Most traps leave a burglar in need of immediate
  healing. If the players Make Camp near the trap, the burglar can disarm it by
  the time camp is broken.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h2>Minstrel</h2>

  <p>When a smiling face is needed to smooth things over or negotiate a deal a
  minstrel is always happy to lend their services for the proper price.</p>

  <p><br /><strong>A Hero&rsquo;s Welcome&mdash;</strong>When you enter a place
  of food, drink, or entertainment with a minstrel you will be treated as a
  friend by everyone present (unless your actions prove otherwise). You also
  subtract the minstrel&rsquo;s skill from all prices in town.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h2>Priest</h2>

  <p>Priests are the lower ranking clergy of a religion, performing minor
  offices and regular sacraments. While not granted spells themselves, they are
  able to call upon their deity for minor aid.</p>

  <p><br /><strong>Ministry&mdash;</strong>When you make camp with a priest if
  you would normally heal you heal +skill HP.</p>

  <p><br /><strong>First Aid&mdash;</strong>When a priest staunches your wounds
  heal 2&times;skill HP. You take -1 forward as their healing is painful and
  distracting.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h2>Protector</h2>

  <p>A protector stands between their employer and the blades, fangs, teeth, and
  spells that would harm them.</p>

  <p><strong>Sentry&mdash;</strong>When a protector stands between you and an
  attack you increase your armor against that attack by the defender&rsquo;s
  skill, then reduce their skill by 1 until they receive healing or have time to
  mend.</p>

  <p><br /><strong>Intervene&mdash;</strong>When a protector helps you defy
  danger you may opt to take +1 from their aid. If you do you cannot get a 10+
  result, a 10+ instead counts as a 7&ndash;9.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h2>Tracker</h2>

  <p>Trackers know the secrets of following a trail, but they don&rsquo;t have
  the experience with strange creatures and exotic locales that make for a great
  hunter.</p>

  <p><br /><strong>Track&mdash;</strong>When a tracker is given time to study a
  trail while Making Camp, when camp is broken they can follow the trail to the
  next major change in terrain, travel, or weather.</p>

  <p><br /><strong>Guide&mdash;</strong>When a tracker leads the way you
  automatically succeed on any Perilous Journey of a distance (in rations) lower
  than the tracker&rsquo;s skill.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h2>Warrior</h2>

  <p>Warriors are not masters of combat, but they are handy with a weapon.</p>

  <p><br /><strong>Man-at-arms&mdash;</strong>When you deal damage while a
  warrior aids you add their skill to the damage done. If your attack results in
  consequences (like a counter attack) the man-at-arms takes the brunt of
  it.</p>
