    biography: >-
      <p>Oh, an emissary! How nice. I suspect you didn’t know the gnolls had
      ambassadors, did you? Yes, even these mangy hyenas have to make nice
      sometimes. No, no, not with us. Nor the dwarves, neither. No, the emissary
      is the one, among his packmates, who trucks directly with their dripping
      demon lord. Frightening? Too right. Every hound has a master with his hand
      on the chain. This gnoll hears his master’s voice. Hears it and obeys.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To share divine insight</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Pass on demonic influence</li>

      <li>Drive the pack into a fervor</li>

      </ul>
