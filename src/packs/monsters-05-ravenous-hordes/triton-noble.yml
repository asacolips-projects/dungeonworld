    biography: >-
      <p>The triton ruling houses were chosen, they say, at the dawn of time.
      Granted lordship over all the races of the sea by some now-forgotten god.
      These bloodlines continue, passing rulership from father to daughter and
      mother to son through the ages. Each is allowed to rule their city in
      whatever way they chooseâ€”some alone or with their spouses, others in
      council of brothers and sisters. In ages past, they were known for their
      sagacity and bloodlines of even-temper were respected above all else. The
      tidecallers prophecy is changing that: nobles are expected to be strong,
      not wise. The nobles have begun to respond, and it is feared by some that
      the ancient blood is changing forever. It may be too late to turn back.
      Time and tide wait for none.</p>
