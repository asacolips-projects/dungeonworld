    biography: >-
      <p>The orcish horde is a savage, bloodthirsty, and hateful collection of
      tribes. There are myths and stories that tell of the origin of their
      rage—a demon curse, a homeland destroyed, elven magic gone wrong—but the
      truth has been lost to time. Every able orc, be it man or woman, child or
      elder, swears fealty to the warchief and their tribe and bears the jagged
      blade of a bloodwarrior. Men are trained to fight and kill—orcs are born
      to it.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To fight</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Fight with abandon</li>

      <li>Revel in destruction</li>

      </ul>
