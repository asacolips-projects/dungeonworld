      <blockquote>

      <p>Before you set out across the hordeland, brave sir, hark a moment to
      the tale of Sir Regnus. Regnus was like you, sir—a paladin of the Order,
      all a-shine in his plated armor and with a shield as tall as a man. Proud
      he was of it, too—Mirrorshield, he called himself. Tale goes that he’d set
      his eyes on rescuing some lost priest, a kidnap from the abbey on the
      borders. Regnus came across some orcs in his travels, a dozen or so, and
      thought, as one might, that they’d be no match. Battle was joined and all
      was well until one of them orcs emerged from the fray with a hammer bigger
      than any man ought to be able to wield. Built more like an ogre or a
      troll, they say it was, and with a single swing, it crushed Regnus to the
      ground, shield and all. It were no ordinary orc, they say. It were a
      breaker. They can’t make plate of their own, see, so maybe it’s jealousy
      drives these burly things to crush and shatter the way they do. Effective
      tactic, though. Careful out there.</p>
