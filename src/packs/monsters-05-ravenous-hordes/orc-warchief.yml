    biography: >-
      <p>There are chiefs and there are leaders of the tribes among the orcs.
      There are those who rise to seize power and fall under the machinations of
      their foes. There is but one Warchief. One orc in all the horde who stands
      above the rest, bearing the blessings of the One-Eyes and the Shamans
      both. But one who walks with the elements under Night. But one who bears
      the Iron Sword of Ages and carries the ancient grudge against the civil
      races on his shoulders. The Warchief is to be respected, to be obeyed and
      above all else, to be feared. All glory to the Warchief.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To lead</p>

      <li>Make a show of power</li>

      <li>Enrage the tribes</li>
