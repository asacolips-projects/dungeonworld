    biography: >-
      <p>Red sails fly in the southern sea. Red sails and ships of bone, old
      wood and iron. The warfleet of the horde. Orcs down that way have taken to
      the sea, harassing island towns and stealing away with fishermen and their
      kin. It’s said the custom is spreading north and the orcs learn the value
      of free work. Taken to it like a sacred duty—especially if they can get
      their hands on elves. Hard to think of a grimmer fate than to live out
      your life on an orcish galley, back bent under the lash.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To take</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Take a captive</li>

      <li>Pin someone under a net</li>

      <li>Drug them</li>

      </ul>
