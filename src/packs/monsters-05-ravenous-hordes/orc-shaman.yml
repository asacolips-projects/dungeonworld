    biography: >-
      <p>The orcs are as old a race as any. They cast bones in the dirt and
      called to the gods in the trees and stone as the elves built their first
      cities. They have waged wars, conquered kingdoms, and fallen into
      corruption in the aeons it took for men to crawl from their caves and
      dwarves to first see the light of the sun. Fitting, then, that the old
      ways still hold. They summon the powers of the world to work, to fight and
      to protect their people, as they have since the first nights.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To strengthen orc-kind</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Give protection of earth</li>

      <li>Give power of fire</li>

      <li>Give swiftness of water</li>

      <li>Give clarity of air</li>

      </ul>
