  details:
    biography: >-
      <p>At the heart of every hive, no matter its size or kind, lives a queen.
      As large as any giant, she sits protected by her guard, served by every
      drone and taskmaster with her own, singular purpose: to spread her kind
      and grow the hive. To birth the eggs. To nurture. We do not understand the
      minds of these creatures but it is known they can communicate with their
      children, somehow, over vast distances and that they begin to teach them
      the ways of earth and stone and war while still pale and wriggling larvae,
      without a word. To kill one is to set chaos on the hive; without their
      queen, the rest turn on one another in a mad, blind rage.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To spread formians</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Call every formian it spawned</li>

      <li>Release a half-formed larval mutation</li>

      <li>Organize and issue orders</li>

      </ul>
