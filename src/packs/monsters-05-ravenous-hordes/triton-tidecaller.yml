    biography: >-
      <p>Part priest, part outcast among their kind, the tidecaller speaks with
      the voice of the deeps. They can be known by their mutationsâ€”transparent
      skin, perhaps, or rows of teeth like a shark. Glowing eyes or fingertips,
      angler-lights in the darkness of their underwater kingdom. They speak in a
      strange tongue that can call and command creatures of the sea. They ride
      wild hippocampi and cast strange spells that rot through the wooden decks
      of ships or encrust them with barnacles heavy enough to sink. It is the
      tidecallers who come, now, back to the cities of the triton, bearing word
      that the prophecy is coming to pass. The world of men will drown in icy
      brine. The tidecallers speak and the lords begin to listen.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To bring on The Flood</p>
