    biography: >-
      <p>Every pack has its top dog. Bigger, maybe—that’d be the simplest way.
      Often, though, with these lank and filthy mutts, it’s not about size or
      sharp teeth but about cruelty. About a willingness to kill your brothers
      and eat them while the pack watches. Willingness to desecrate the pack in
      a way that cows them to you. If they’re that awful to each other—to their
      living kin—think about how they must view us. It’s hard to be mere meat in
      a land of carnivores.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To drive the pack</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Demand obedience</li>

      <li>Send the pack to hunt</li>

      </ul>
