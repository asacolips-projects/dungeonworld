    biography: >-
      <p>Stained in the unholy ritual of Anointing By The Nightâ€™s Blood, some
      warriors of the horde rise to a kind of twisted knighthood. They trade
      their sanity for this honor, stepping halfway into a world of swirling
      madness. This makes berserkers the greatest of their tribe, though as time
      passes, the chaos spreads. The rare berserker that lives more than a few
      years becomes horrible and twisted, growing horns or an extra arm with
      which to grasp the iron cleavers they favor in battle.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To rage</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Fly into a frenzy</li>

      <li>Unleash chaos</li>

      </ul>
