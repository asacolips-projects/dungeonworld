    biography: >-
      <p>With good cause, they say that these creatures (like all insects,
      really) are claimed by the powers of Law. They are order made flesh—a
      perfectly stratified society in which every larva, hatchling and adult
      knows its place in the great hive. The formian is some strange
      intersection of men and ants. (Though there are winged tribes that look
      like wasps out in the Western Desert, I’ve heard. And some with great
      sawtooth arms like mantids in the forests of the east.) Tall, with a hard
      shell and a harder mind, these particular formians are the bottom caste.
      They work the hills and honeycombs with single-minded joy that can be
      known only by such an alien mind.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To follow orders</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Raise the alarm</li>

      <li>Create value for the hive</li>

      <li>Assimilate</li>

      </ul>
