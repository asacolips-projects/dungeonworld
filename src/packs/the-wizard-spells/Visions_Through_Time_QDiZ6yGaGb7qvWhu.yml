  description: >-
    <p>Cast this spell and gaze into a reflective surface to see into the depths
    of time. The GM will reveal the details of a grim portent to you—a bleak
    event that will come to pass without your intervention. They’ll tell you
    something useful about how you can interfere with the grim portent’s dark
    outcomes. Rare is the portent that claims “You’ll live happily ever after.”
    Sorry.</p>
