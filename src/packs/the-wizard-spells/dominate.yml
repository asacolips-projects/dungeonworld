    one hold to make the target take one of these actions:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Speak a few words of your choice</li>

    <li>Give you something they hold</li>

    <li>Make a concerted attack on a target of your choice</li>

    <li>Truthfully answer one question</li>

    </ul>

    <p>If you run out of hold the spell ends. If the target takes damage you
