    <p>Your touch pushes your mind into someone else’s. You gain 1d4 hold. Spend
    one hold to make the target take one of these actions:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Speak a few words of your choice</li>

    <li>Give you something they hold</li>

    <li>Make a concerted attack on a target of your choice</li>

    <li>Truthfully answer one question</li>

    </ul>

    <p>If you run out of hold the spell ends. If the target takes damage you
    lose 1 hold. While the spell is ongoing you cannot cast a spell.</p>
