  description: >-
    <p>Choose a 5th level or lower spell you know. Describe a trigger condition
    using a number of words equal to your level. The chosen spell is held until
    you choose to unleash it or the trigger condition is met, whichever happens
    first. You donâ€™t have to roll for the held spell, it just takes effect. You
    may only have a single contingent spell held at a time; if you cast
    Contingency while you have a held spell, the new held spell replaces the old
    one.</p>
