  description: >-
    <p>Choose a 5th level or lower spell you know. Describe a trigger condition
    using a number of words equal to your level. The chosen spell is held until
    you choose to unleash it or the trigger condition is met, whichever happens
    first. You don’t have to roll for the held spell, it just takes effect. You
    may only have a single contingent spell held at a time; if you cast
    Contingency while you have a held spell, the new held spell replaces the old
    one.</p>
