  description: >-
    <p>You perform minor tricks of true magic. If you touch an item as part of
    the casting you can make cosmetic changes to it: clean it, soil it, cool it,
    warm it, flavor it, or change its color. If you cast the spell without
    touching an item you can instead create minor illusions no bigger than
    yourself. Prestidigitation illusions are crude and clearly illusions—they
    won’t fool anyone, but they might entertain them.</p>
