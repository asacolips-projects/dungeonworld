  description: >-
    <p>An item you touch glows with arcane light, about as bright as a torch. It
    gives off no heat or sound and requires no fuel, but it is otherwise like a
    mundane torch. You have complete control of the color of the flame. The
    spell lasts as long as it is in your presence.</p>
