    <p>When you <strong>weave a performance into a basic spell</strong>, choose
    an ally and an effect:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Heal 1d8 damage</li>

    <li>+1d4 forward to damage</li>

    <li>Their mind is shaken clear of one enchantment</li>

    <li>The next time someone successfully assists the target with aid, they get
    +2 instead of +1</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Then roll+CHA. • On a 10+, the ally gets the selected effect. • On a 7-9,
    your spell still works, but you draw unwanted attention or your magic
    reverberates to other targets affecting them as well, GM’s choice.</p>

    <p>Heal roll: [[/roll 1d8]]</p>

    <p>Forward to damage roll: [[/roll 1d4]]</p>
