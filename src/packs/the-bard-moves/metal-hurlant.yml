    <p>When you <strong>shout with great force or play a shattering note
    </strong>choose a target and roll+CON. • On a 10+ the target takes 1d10
    damage and is deafened for a few minutes. • On a 7-9 you still damage your
    target, but it’s out of control: the GM will choose an additional target
    nearby.</p>
