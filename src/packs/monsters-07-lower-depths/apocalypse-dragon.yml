    biography: >-
      <p>The end of all things shall be a burningâ€”of tree and earth and of the
      air itself. It shall come upon the plains and mountains not from beyond
      this world but from within it. Birthed from the womb of deepest earth
      shall come the Dragon that Will End the World. In its passing all will
      become ash and bile and the Dungeon World a dying thing will drift through
      planar space devoid of life. They say to worship the Apocalypse Dragon is
      to invite madness. They say to love it is to know oblivion. The awakening
      is coming.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To end the world</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Set a disaster in motion</li>

      <li>Breathe forth the elements</li>

      <li>Act with perfect foresight</li>

      </ul>
