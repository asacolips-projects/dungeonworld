    biography: >-
      <p>Driven from the city, a cultist finds sanctuary in towns and villages.
      Discovered there, he flees to the hills and scratches his devotion on the
      cave walls. Found out again, he is chased with knife and torch into the
      depths, crawling deeper and deeper until, in the deepest places, he loses
      his way. First, he forgets his name. Then he forgets his shape. His chaos
      gods, most beloved, bless him with a new one.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To undermine the established order</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Rewrite reality</li>

      <li>Unleash chaos from containment</li>

      </ul>
