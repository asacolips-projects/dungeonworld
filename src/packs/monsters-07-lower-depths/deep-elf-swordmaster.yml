    biography: >-
      <p>The deep elves lost the sweetness and gentle peace of their bright
      cousins ages ago, but they did not abandon grace. They move with a
      swiftness and beauty that would bring a tear to any warrior’s eye. In the
      dark, they’ve practiced. A cruelty has infested their swordsmanship—a
      wickedness comes to the fore. Barbed blades and whips replace the shining
      pennant-spears of elven battles on the surface. The swordmasters of the
      deep elf clans do not merely seek to kill, but to punish with every stroke
      of their blades. Wickedness and pain are their currency.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To punish unbelievers</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Inflict pain beyond measure</li>

      <li>Use the dark to advantage</li>

      </ul>
