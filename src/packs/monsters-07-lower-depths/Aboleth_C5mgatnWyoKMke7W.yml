    biography: >-
      <p>Deep below the surface of the world, in freshwater seas untouched by
      the sun, dwell the aboleth. Fish the size of whales, with strange growths
      of gelatinous feelers used to probe the lightless shores. They’re served
      by slaves: blind albino victims of any race unfortunate enough to stumble
      on them, drained of thought and life by the powers of the aboleth’s alien
      mind. In the depths they plot against each other, fishy cultists building
      and digging upward towards the surface until someday, they’ll breach it.
      For now, they sleep and dream and guide their pallid minions to do their
      bidding.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To command</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Invade a mind</li>

      <li>Turn minions on them</li>

      <li>Put a plan in motion</li>

      </ul>
