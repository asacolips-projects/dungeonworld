    biography: >-
      <p>Ambitious and territorial above nearly all else, the naga are very
      rarely found without a well-formed and insidious cult of followers. You’ll
      see it in many mountain towns—a snake sigil scrawled on a tavern wall or a
      local church burned to the ground. People going missing in the mines. Men
      and women wearing the mark of the serpent. At the core of it all lies a
      naga: an old race now fallen into obscurity, still preening with the head
      of a man over its coiled, serpent body. Variations of these creatures
      exist depending on their bloodline and original purpose, but they are all
      master manipulators and magical forces to be reckoned with.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To lead</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Send a follower to their death</li>

      <li>Use old magic</li>

      <li>Offer a deal or bargain</li>

      </ul>
