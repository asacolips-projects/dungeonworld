    biography: >-
      <p>It was not so simple a thing as a war over religion or territory. No
      disagreement of queens led to the great sundering of the elves. It was
      sadness. It was the very diminishing of the world by the lesser races. The
      glory of all the elves had built was cracking and turning to glass. Some,
      then, chose to separate themselves from the world; wracked with tears they
      turned their backs on men and dwarves. There were others, though, that
      were overcome with something new. A feeling no elf had felt before. Spite.
      Hatred filled these elves and twisted them and they turned on their weaker
      cousins. Some still remain after the great exodus below. Some hide amongst
      us with spider-poisoned blades, meting out that strangest of punishments:
      elven vengeance.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To spite the surface races</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Poison them</li>

      <li>Unleash an ancient spell</li>

      <li>Call reinforcements</li>

      </ul>
