    biography: >-
      <p>The spirits of the trees and the lady sunlight are far, far from home
      in the depths where the deep elves dwell. New gods were found there,
      waiting for their children to come home. Gods of the spiders, the fungal
      forests, and things that whisper in the forbidden caves. The deep elves,
      ever attuned to the world around them, listened with hateful intent to
      their new gods and found a new source of power. Hate calls to hate and
      grim alliances were made. Even among these spiteful ranks, piety finds a
      way to express itself.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To pass on divine vengeance</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Weave spells of hatred and malice</li>

      <li>Rally the deep elves</li>

      <li>Pass on divine knowledge</li>

      </ul>
