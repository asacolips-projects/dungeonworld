    biography: >-
      <p>The herd came from a pact made in the days when folk still inhabited
      the Blasted Steppes. Horselords, they were, who travelled those lands.
      Born in the saddle, it was said. One of theirs, in a bid to dominate his
      peers, made a black pact with some fell power and traded away his finest
      horses. He had some power, sure—but what’s a thousand year dynasty when a
      life is so short? Now the fiends of the pit ride on the finest horses ever
      seen. Coats of shining oil and manes of tormented flame: these are steeds
      of hell’s cavalry.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To ride rampant</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Sheath a rider in hellish flame</li>

      <li>Drive them away</li>

      </ul>
