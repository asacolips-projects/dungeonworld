    biography: >-
      <p>The Tarrasque. Legendary unstoppable juggernaut—eater of cities and
      swallower of ships, horses, and knights. A creature unseen in an age but
      about whom all kinds of stories are told. One thread of truth weaves
      through these stories. It cannot be killed. No blade can pierce its stony
      shell nor spell penetrate the shield it somehow bears. Stories say,
      though, that the will of one pure soul can send it to slumber, though what
      that means and, by the gods, where such a thing might be found, pray we do
      not ever need to learn. It slumbers. Somewhere in the periphery of the
      planar edge, it sleeps for now.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To consume</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Swallow a person, group, or place whole</li>

      <li>Release a remnant of a long-eaten place from its gullet</li>

      </ul>
