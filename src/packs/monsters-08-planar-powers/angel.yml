      <blockquote>

      <p>So was it written that the heavens opened up to Avra’hal and did an
      angel from the clouds emerge to speak unto her and so did it appear to her
      as her firstborn daughter—beautiful, of ebon skin and golden eyes—and did
      Avra’hal weep to see it. ‘Be not afraid,’ it commanded her. ‘Go to the
      villages I have shown you in your dreams and unto them show the word I
      have written on your soul.’ Avra’hal wept and wept and did agree to do
      this and did take up her sword and tome and did into the villages go, a
      great thirst for blood on her lips for the word the angel wrote upon the
      soul of Avra’hal was ‘kill’.</p>
