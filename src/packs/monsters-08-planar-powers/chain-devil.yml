    biography: >-
      <p>Do you think the phrase “drag him to hell” means nothing? It is
      unfortunately literal, in the case of the chain devil. Appearing
      differently to each victim, this summoned creature has but a single
      purpose: to wrap its victim up in binding coils and take it away to a
      place of torment. Sometimes it will come as a man-shaped mass of rusting
      iron, hooks and coils of mismatched links. Other times, a roiling tangle
      of rope or kelp or twisted bloody bedsheets. The results are always the
      same.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To capture</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Take a captive</li>

      <li>Return to whence it came</li>

      <li>Torture with glee</li>

      </ul>
