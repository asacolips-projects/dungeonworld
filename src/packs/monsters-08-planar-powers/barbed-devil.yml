    biography: >-
      <p>There are a thousand forms of devil, maybe more. Some common and some
      unique. Each time the Inquisitors discover a new one they write it into
      the Tormentors Codex and the knowledge is shared among the abbeys in the
      hope that atrocities of that particular sort won’t find their way into the
      world again. The barbed devil has long been known to the brothers and
      sisters of the Inquisition. It appears only at a site of great violence or
      when called by a wayward summoner. Covered in sharp quills, this
      particular demon revels in the spilling of blood, preferably by impaling
      victims piecemeal or in whole upon its thorns and letting them die there.
      Cruel but not particularly effective beyond slaughter. A low inquisitorial
      priority.</p>

      <p>Instinct: To rend flesh and spill blood</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Impale someone</li>

      <li>Kill indiscriminately</li>

      </ul>
