    <p>You’ve heard them, sitting around the campfire. Bragging about this
    battle or that. About how their gods are smiling on your merry band. You
    count your coins and smile to yourself—this is the thrill above all. You
    alone know the secret of Dungeon World—filthy filthy lucre.</p>

    <p>Sure, they give you lip for all the times you’ve snuck off alone but
    without you, who among them wouldn’t have been dissected by a flying
    guillotine or poisoned straight to death by some ancient needle trap? So,
    let them complain. When you’re done with all this delving you’ll toast their
    hero’s graves.</p>

    <p>From your castle. Full of gold. You rogue.</p>
