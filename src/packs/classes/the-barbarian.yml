    <p>Hither you came from parts unknown. Sword in hand—a reaver. A slayer.</p>

    <p>Let the wizard cast his spells. What good is magick when steel cuts
    through flesh and bone just the same? The Paladin swears fealty to the
    divine. She can keep her fairy tale god—you are your own master.</p>

    <p>You hail from the far reaches of Dungeon World in search of—what? Glory?
    Treasure? Spilt blood? In the end it matters not. They call you barbarian.
    Uncivilized. Let them. You know better. Their world of nobles and laws is
    fleeting.</p>

    <p>You know what is best in life.</p>

        not from around here. At the beginning of each session, the GM will ask
        you something about your homeland, why you left, or what you left
        behind. If you answer them, mark XP.
