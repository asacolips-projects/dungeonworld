    <p>Hell awaits. An eternity of torment in fire or ice or whatever best suits
    the sins of the damned throngs of Dungeon World. All that stands between the
    pits of that grim torture and salvation is you. Holy man, armored war
    machine, templar of the Good and the Light, right? The cleric may say his
    prayers at night to the gods, dwelling in their heavens. The fighter may
    wield his sharp sword in the name of “good” but you know. Only you.</p>

    <p>Eyes, hands, and sweet killing blow of the gods, you are. Yours is the
    gift of righteousness and virtue. Of justice. Vision, too. A purity of
    intent that your companions do not have.</p>

    <p>So guide these fools, paladin. Take up your holy cause and bring
    salvation to the wastrel world.</p>

    <p>Vae victis, right?</p>
