    <p>These city-born folk you travel with. Have they heard the call of the
    wolf? Felt the winds howl in the bleak deserts of the East? Have they hunted
    their prey with the bow and the knife like you? Hell no. That’s why they
    need you.</p>

    <p>Guide. Hunter. Creature of the wilds. You are these things and more. Your
    time in the wilderness may have been solitary until now, but the call of
    some greater thing—call it fate if you like—has cast your lot with these
    folk. Brave, they may be. Powerful and strong, too. You know the secrets of
    the spaces between, though.</p>

    <p>Without you, they’d be lost. Blaze a trail through the blood and dark,
    strider.</p>
