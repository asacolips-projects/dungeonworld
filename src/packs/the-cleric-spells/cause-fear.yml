  description: >-
    <p>Choose a target you can see and a nearby object. The target is afraid of
    the object so long as you maintain the spell. Their reaction is up to them:
    flee, panic, beg, fight. While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a
    spell. You cannot target entities with less than animal intelligence
    (magical constructs, undead, automatons, and the like).</p>
