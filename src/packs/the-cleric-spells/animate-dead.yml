  description: >-
    <p>You invoke a hungry spirit to possess a recently-dead body and serve you.
    This creates a zombie that follows your orders to the best of its limited
    abilities. Treat the zombie as a character, but with access to only the
    basic moves. It has a +1 modifier for all stats and 1 HP. The zombie also
    gets your choice of 1d4 of these traits:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>It’s talented. Give one stat a +2 modifier.</li>

    <li>It’s durable. It has +2 HP for each level you have.</li>

    <li>It has a functioning brain and can complete complex tasks. • It does not
    appear obviously dead, at least for a day or two.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>The zombie lasts until it is destroyed by taking damage in excess of its
    HP, or until you end the spell. While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to
    cast a spell.</p>
