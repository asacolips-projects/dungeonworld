  description: >-
    <p>Tell the GM you would like to resurrect a corpse whose soul has not yet
    fully departed this world. Resurrection is always possible, but the GM will
    give you one or more (possibly all) of these conditions to&nbsp;fulfill:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>It’s going to take days/weeks/months</li>

    <li>You must get help from ____</li>

    <li>It will require a lot of money</li>

    <li>You must sacrifice ____ to do it</li>

    </ul>

    <p>The GM may, depending on the circumstances, allow you to resurrect the
    corpse now, with the understanding that the&nbsp;conditions must be met
    before it’s&nbsp;permanent, or require you to meet the conditions before the
    corpse is resurrected.</p>
