  description: >-
    <p>Choose an appendage on the target such as an arm, tentacle, or wing. The
    appendage is magically severed from their body, causing no damage but
    considerable pain. Missing an appendage may, for example, keep a winged
    creature from flying, or a bull from goring you on its horns. While this
    spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.</p>
