  description: >-
    <p>None know from whence this spear of twisted white coral comes. Those who
    bear it too long find their minds full of alien dreams and begin to hear the
    strange thoughts of the Others. None are impervious. Used against any
    “natural” target (men, goblins, owlbears and the like) the Spire acts as a
    mere mortal spear. Its true purpose is to do harm to those things whose
    strange natures protect them against mundane weapons. Used thus, the Spire
    can wound foes otherwise invulnerable to harm. The wielder will recognize
    these twisted foes on sight—the Spire knows its own.</p>
