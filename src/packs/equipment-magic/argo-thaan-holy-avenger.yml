  description: >-
    <p>There are many swords in this world, but there is only one Argo-thaan. It
    is a blade of gold, silver and light, revered as a holy relic by all orders
    and religions for whom Good rings true. Its touch is a blessing and to many,
    the sight of it brings tears of joy.</p>

    <p>In the hands of a paladin, it strikes true and strong. A paladin wielding
    it increases their damage die to d12 and has access to every paladin move.
    As well, Argo-thaan can harm any creature of Evil, regardless of any
    defenses it may have. No Evil creature may touch it without suffering agony.
    In the hands of any non-paladin, it is merely a sword, heavier and more
    cumbersome than mostâ€”it gains the awkward tag.</p>

    <p>Argo-thaan, while not intelligent, will forever be drawn to a cause of
    true Good, like iron to a magnet.</p>
