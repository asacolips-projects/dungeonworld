    <p>An old skull, missing its jaw and very much worse-for-wear. The skull
    remembers the folly of its former owner—a man with more honor than sense.
    Once per night, the owner of the skull can ask “Who has it in for me?” and
    the skull will give up one name in a sad, lonely voice. If the owner of the
    skull is ever killed, it disappears surreptitiously. No one knows where it
    might turn up next.</p>
