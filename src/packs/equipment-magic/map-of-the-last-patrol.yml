  description: >-
    <p>An ancient order of brave rangers once patrolled the land, protecting
    villages and warning kings and queens of encroaching danger.
    They’re&nbsp;long gone, now, but their legacy remains. This map, when marked
    with the blood of a group of people, will always show their location— so
    long as they remain within the bounds of the map.</p>
