  description: >-
    <p>An odd, hand-carved wooden duck. Who would make such a funny thing? While
    you bear it, you find yourself an exceptionally gifted storytellerâ€”no matter
    the language, you can make yourself and your story clear to any audience.
    They will understand your meaning, if not your words.</p>
