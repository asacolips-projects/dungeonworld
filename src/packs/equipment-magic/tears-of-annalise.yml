  description: >-
    <p>Cloudy red gemstones the size of a thumbnail, the Tears of Annalise are
    always found in pairs. When swallowed by two different people, they bind the
    swallowers togetherâ€”when either feels strong emotions (particularly sadness,
    loss, fear or desire) the other feels it, as well. The effects last until
    one spills the blood of the other.</p>
