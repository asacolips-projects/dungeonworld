  description: >-
    <p>Who hasn’t always wanted to soar the pretty blue sky? In an attempt to
    grant the wishes of land-bound folk, these great magical wings were created.
    Known by many names and crafted by as many mages, they commonly take the
    shape of the wings of whatever local birds hold affection. Worn by means of
    a harness or, in some dire cases, a surgical procedure.</p>

    <p>When you take to the air with these magical wings, roll+DEX. ✴On a 10+,
    your flight is controlled and you may stay aloft as long as you like. ✴On a
    7–9, you make it aloft but your flight is short or erratic and
    unpredictable, your choice. ✴On a 6-, you make it aloft, but the coming-down
    part and everything between is up to the GM.</p>
