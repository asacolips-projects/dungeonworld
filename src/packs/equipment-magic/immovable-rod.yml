    <p>A funny metal rod with a button on it. Press the button and the rod just
    sticks. It freezes in place—in midair, standing up or lying down. It can’t
    be moved. Pull it, push it, try as hard as you like, the rod stays. Maybe it
    can be destroyed, maybe it can’t. Push the button again and it’s free—take
    it along with you. Might be useful to have such a stubborn thing along.</p>
