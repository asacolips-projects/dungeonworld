  description: >-
    <p>What mixed-up dummy made this? Shields are meant to repel metal, not draw
    it in! Emblazoned with a lion rampant, the Lodestone Shield has the power to
    pull blades and arrows to it. When you defend against enemies using metal
    weapons you can spend one hold, per target, to disarm them. Also, sometimes
    you’ll find a handful of loose change stuck to it.</p>
