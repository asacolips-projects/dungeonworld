  description: >-
    <p>An ancient wooden wheel, as might appear on a war-wagon, banded with
    steel. On a glance, it appears to be nothing special—many spokes are
    shattered and the thing seems mundane. Under the scrutiny of magic or the
    eyes of an expert, its true nature is revealed: the Burning Wheel is a gift
    from the God of Fire and burns with his authority.</p>

    <p>When you hold The Burning Wheel and speak a god’s name, roll+CON. ✴On a
    7+, the god you name takes notice and grants you an audience. An audience
    with a god is not without a price: on a 10+, you choose one of your stats
    and reduce it to the next lowest modifier (for example, a 14 is +1, so it
    would be reduced to 12, a +0). ✴On a 7–9, the GM chooses which stat to
    reduce.</p>

    <p>Once used, the Burning Wheel ignites and burns with brilliant light. It
    does not confer any protection from those flames, nor does it provide any
    bonus to swimming.</p>
