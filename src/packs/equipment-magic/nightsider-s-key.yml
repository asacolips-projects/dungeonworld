    <p>This key unlocks any door for you, provided you don’t belong where you
    intend to go. So long as you do nothing that would alert another to your
    presence (remaining unheard, unseen and unnoticed) and takes nothing more
    than your memories out with you, the key’s magic will prevent your intrusion
    from ever being discovered. It’s like you were never there at all.</p>
