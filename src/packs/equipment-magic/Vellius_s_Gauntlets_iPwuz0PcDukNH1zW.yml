    <p>Crafted in the name of Vellius the Clumsy, Vellius the Butter-Fingered,
    Vellius the Clod, these gloves of simple cloth prevent you from dropping any
    object you don’t intent to. You cannot be disarmed and will not fall from
    any rope or ladder, for example. This item can get very messy if you have
    something strong pulling at your legs while you grip onto something
    solid.</p>
