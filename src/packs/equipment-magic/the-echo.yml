  description: >-
    <p>A seemingly empty bottle. Once unstoppered, the whispers of another plane
    resound once and fall silent. In the silence, the bearer learns in his soul
    the coming of one great danger and how he can avoid it. At any point after
    you use the Echo, you can ignore the results of any single die roll—yours or
    another player’s—and roll again. Once opened, the Echo is released and gone
    forever.</p>
