  description: >-
    <p>A cape of rich black velvet outside and sparkling with tiny points of
    light within, this cloak bends fate, time and reality around it to protect
    the wearer, who may defy danger with whatever stat they like. To do this,
    the wearer invokes the cloak’s magic and their player describes how the
    cloak helps “break the rules.” They can deflect a fireball with CHA by
    convincing it they deserve to live or elude a fall by applying the mighty
    logic of their INT to prove the fall won’t hurt. The cloak makes it so. It
    can be used once for each stat before losing its magic.</p>
