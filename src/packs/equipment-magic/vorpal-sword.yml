  description: >-
    <p>Snicker-snack and all that. Sharp as anything, this simple-seeming sword
    means to separate one thing from anotherâ€”the limb from the body or folk from
    their lives. When you deal damage with the Vorpal Sword, your enemy must
    choose something (an item, an advantage, a limb) and lose it,
    permanently.</p>
