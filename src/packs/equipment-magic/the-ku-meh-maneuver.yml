  description: >-
    <p>A great, leathery tome worn shiny by the hands of a hundred great
    generals, this book is often passed from warrior to warrior, from father to
    son along the great battle lines that have divided Dungeon World’s past.
    Anyone reading it may, upon finishing for the first time, roll+INT. ✴On a
    10+, hold 3. ✴On a 7-9, hold 1. You may spend your hold to advise a
    companion on some matter of strategic or tactical significance. This advice
    allows you to, at any time, regardless of distance, roll to aid them on any
    one roll. On a miss, the GM can hold 1 and spend it to apply -2 to any roll
    of yours or the poor sap who listened to your advice.</p>
