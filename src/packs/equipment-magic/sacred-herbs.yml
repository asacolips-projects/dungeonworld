  description: >-
    <p>The sacred herbs, collected and prepared by an order of lost
    wizard-monks, can be found in bundles with two or three uses to them. Kept
    dry, they last indefinitely. When smoked in a pipe or consumed in an incense
    burner and the thick, blue smoke inhaled, these herbs will grant you strange
    visions of faraway places and distant times. If you focus your will on a
    particular person, place or thing, the herbs will respond: roll+WIS. ✴On a
    10+, the vision is clear and useful— yielding some valid information. ✴On a
    7–9, the vision is about the thing desired, but is unclear, fraught with
    metaphor or somehow difficult to understand. ✴On a miss, the GM will ask
    you, “What is it you fear most?” You must answer honestly, of course.</p>
