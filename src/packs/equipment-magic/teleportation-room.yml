  description: >-
    <p>James Ninefingers, eccentric genius mage, created these room-sized
    magical apparati. A stone chamber etched with runes and scribblings, glowing
    with a faint blue light. When you enter and say aloud the name of a
    location, roll+INT. ✴On a 10+, you arrive exactly where you’d intended. ✴On
    a 7–9, the GM chooses a safe location nearby. ✴On a miss, you end up
    someplace. Maybe it’s nearby? It’s definitely not safe. Strange things
    sometimes happen to those who bend time and space with these devices.</p>
