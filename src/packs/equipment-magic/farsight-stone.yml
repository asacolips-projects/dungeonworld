  description: >-
    <p>Swirling clouds fill this smoky orb and those in its presence often hear
    strange whispers. In ancient times, it was part of a network of such stones,
    used to communicate and surveil across great distances. When you gaze into
    the stone, name a location and roll+WIS. ✴On a 10+, you see a clear vision
    of the location and can maintain it as long as you concentrate on the orb.
    ✴On a 7–9, you still see the vision, but you draw the attention of some
    other thing (an angel, a demon, or the holder of another Farsight stone)
    that uses the stone to surveil you, as well.</p>
