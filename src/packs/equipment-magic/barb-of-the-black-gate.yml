    <p>A nail or spike, twisted and forever cold, said to have been pried from
    the Gates of Death. When hammered into a corpse, it disappears and ensures
    that corpse will never be risen againâ€”no magic short of that of Death
    himself can reignite the flame of life (natural or otherwise) in the
    body.</p>
